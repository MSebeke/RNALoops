is a special version of <a href="alg_dotBracket.gap">alg_dotBracket.gap</a> for alignments as input instead of a single sequence. The only difference is the type for the alphabet, i.e. the terminal parser. It would be nice to just exchange the type via a type synonym, but currently GAP-C is not able to.
