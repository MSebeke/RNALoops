&quot;alg_pknot_dotBracket.gap&quot; is a copy of <a href="?id=alg_dotBracket.gap">alg_dotBracket.gap</a>, but extended to also cover pseudoknots. To unambiguously print crossing base-pairs we need further types of pairs. Thus, the alpha helix of a pseudoknot is represented by <span class="style">[</span> and <span class="style">]</span>; beta helix by <span class="style">{</span> and <span class="style">}</span> and gamma helix (only for <a href="http://bibiserv.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/pkiss/">pKiss</a>) by <span class="style">&lt;</span> and <span class="style">&gt;</span>.
