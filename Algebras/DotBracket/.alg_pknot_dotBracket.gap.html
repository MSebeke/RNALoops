is a copy of <a href="alg_dotBracket.gap">alg_dotBracket.gap</a>, but extended to also cover pseudoknots. To unambiguously print crossing base-pairs we need further types of pairs. Thus, the alpha helix of a pseudoknot is represented by &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot;; beta helix by &quot;{&quot; and &quot;}&quot; and gamma helix (only for pKiss) by &quot;&lq;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot;.
