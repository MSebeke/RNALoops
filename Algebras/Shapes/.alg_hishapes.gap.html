some applications require a position specific type of shapes (see <a href="http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/early/2012/10/24/rna.033548.112.short">Abstract folding space analysis based on helices</a>). Jiabin Huang defined three level of position specific shapes, called helix center shapes (hishapes). The center of a helix is the middle position of the unpaired loop region. For odd regions, the position can be x.5.
alg_hishape_h accounts only for centers in hairpin loops.
alg_hishape_m records centers for multiloops in addition to the hairpin loop centers.
alg_hishape_b extends alg_hishape_m by also recording centers for bulges and internal loops.
