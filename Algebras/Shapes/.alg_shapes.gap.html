&quot;alg_shapes.gap&quot;: Shapes are an abstraction of the concrete Vienna-Dot-Bracket string to the - as we think - most important features of an RNA structure. They come in five different levels, where 5 is the most abstract and 1 the most concrete level. All levels abstract from length and position. For a definition of the levels, see <a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/5/632.short">Faster computation of exact RNA shape probabilities</a>
The file contains five algebras, one for each level. It starts with level 5 and uses the inheritance system of GAP-L to keep the effort of defining the other levels as small as possible. For efficiency reasons we use the special <span class="code">shape</span> (in the file <span class="code">shape_t</i> is a type synonym for <span class="code">shape</span>) data type with a very limited alphabet, i.e. just <span class="code">[</span>, <span class="code">]</span> and <span class="code">_</span>. The advantage of a small alphabet becomes obvious if we have to use a hash of very many different shapes.
