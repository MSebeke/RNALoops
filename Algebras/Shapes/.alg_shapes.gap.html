Shapes are an abstraction of the concrete Vienna-Dot-Bracket string to the - as we think - most important features of an RNA structure. They come in five different levels, where 5 is the most abstract and 1 the most concrete level. All levels abstract from length and position. For a definition of the levels, see <a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/5/632.short">Faster computation of exact RNA shape probabilities</a>
The file contains five algebras, one for each level. It starts with level 5 and uses the inheritance system of GAP-L to keep the effort of defining the other levels as small as possible. For efficiency reasons we use the special <i>shape</i> (in the file <i>shape_t</i> is a type synonym for <i>shape</i>) data type with a very limited alphabet, i.e. just &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot; and &quot;_&quot;. The advantage of a small alphabet becomes obvious if we have to use a hash of very many different shapes.
