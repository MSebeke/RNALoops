&quot;alg_shapes_rope.gap&quot; is identical to <a href="?id=alg_shapes.gap">alg_shapes.gap</a>, but uses the <span class="code">Rope</span> data type instead of <span class="code">shape</span>. This is useful to test hash key generation or develop further shape levels with more than the three characters.
