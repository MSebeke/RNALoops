creating an algebra that counts the number of candidates in the search space is generic and is usually done by GAP-C with the line: &quot;auto alg_count auto count;&quot;. Should you want to play around with stochastical backtracing (aka. Sampling) you need an identity function. The generated count algebra always uses <i>sum</i> as choice function and you cannot extend the auto generated algebra in order to overwrite the choice function. GAP-C actually crashes with a segmentation fault.
