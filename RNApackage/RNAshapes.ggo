description "The program \n\n"

option  "noconv"  -
"Do not automatically substitude nucleotide \"T\" with \"U\""
flag
off

option "erange" e
"Set energy range (kcal/mol)" 
details="This sets the energy range for shape folding (-a), complete suboptimal folding (-s), probability analysis with -P, and consensus shapes analysis (-C). <value> is the difference to the minimum free energy for the sequence."
float
default="5.0"

option "crange" c
"Set energy range (%)" 
details="This sets the energy range as percentage value of the minimum free energy. For example, when -c 10 is specified, and the minimum free energy is -10.0 kcal/mol, the energy range is set to -9.0 to -10.0 kcal/mol."
float
default="10.0"

option "shapetype" t
"Specify shape type"
details="The shape type is the level of abstraction or dissimilarity which defines a different shape. In general, helical regions are depicted by a pair of opening and closing square brackets and unpaired regions are represented as a single underscore. The differences of the shape types are due to whether a structural element (bulge loop, internal loop, multiloop, hairpin loop, stacking region and external loop) contributes to the shape representation: Five types are implemented. Their differences are shown in the following example:\n\n\tAUCGGCGCACAGGACAUCCUAGGUACAAGGCCGCCCGUU\n\t..(((.((..(((....))).(((.....))))))))..\n\n\nType 5: Most abstract - helix nesting pattern and no unpaired regions\n\n\t[[][]]\n\nType 4: helix nesting pattern and unpaired regions in external loop and multiloop\n\n\t[[][]]\n\nType 3: nesting pattern for all loop types but no unpaired regions\n\n\t[[[][]]]\n\nType 2: nesting pattern for all loop types and unpaired regions in external loop and multiloop\n\n\t[_[[][]]]\n\nType 1: Most accurate - all loops and all unpaired\n\n\t_[_[_[]_[]]]_"
