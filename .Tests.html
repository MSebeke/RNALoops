This directory contains a test framework, stolen from Georg Sauthoff, to run some regression tests for the software in this repository. The &quot;truth&quot; is delivered in form of files in the subdirectory &quot;Truth/&quot;, which are outputs of controlled previous runs, which hopefully were correct. 
The file &quot;config&quot; lists all available tests. To run them, go into the Tests directory and type &quot;ksh run.sh ../Truth&quot;. You also find some Perl scripts, which I used to check consistency to the Vienna-Package.
All our grammars do not support lonely base-pairs, because we don't think that they should be considered for stable structures. Furthermore there are no associated energy parameters for them. Should you still want to see structures with lonely base-pairs in your search space, you could easily modify the rule &quot;strong = sr(BASE, weak, BASE) with basepair # h&quot; to just &quot;strong = weak # h&quot;. To do this automatically, run the script &quot;makeLPgrammars.pl&quot; with parameter &quot;generate&quot; and have a look at all the new *.autoLP files in the root directory and the Grammars directory.
