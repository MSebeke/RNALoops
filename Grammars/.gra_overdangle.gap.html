&quot;Grammars/gra_overdangle.gap&quot; essentially is a copy of <a href="?id=gra_nodangle.gap">Grammars/gra_nodangle.gap</a>, but we want to keep names clear. The difference stems from different <a href="?id=alg_mfe.gap">MFE</a> or <a href="?id=alg_pfunc.gap">partition function algebras</a>, not different grammars. And those differences are realized by overloading the few according functions in the main GAP-L file (&quot;overdangle.gap&quot;), not by different algebra files.

Following an idea from splitting the Signature <a href="?id=sig_foldrna.gap">Signatures/sig_foldrna.gap</a>, large parts of commonly used production rules are outsourced into the grammar part file <a href="?id=grapart_basic.gap">Grammars/Parts/grapart_basic.gap</a>.
