Compared to <a href="?id=gra_nodangle.gap">gra_nodangle.gap</a>, each terminal base-pair of a stem is now considered to be dangled onto it in four different ways: not at all (drem), only upstream neighboring base dangles (edl), only downstream neighboring base dangles (edr) or upstream and downstream neighboring bases dangle both (edlr). The same holds for stems within multiloops: ml, mldl, mldr, mldlr. While this is conceptional clean, it inflates the search space and makes the grammar semantically ambiguous regarding the Vienna-Dot-Bracket notation.
