The program <a href="http://bibiserv.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/locomotif/">Locomotif</a> is a graphical editor, letting you literally draw your favorite RNA motif, and converts this drawing into a highly specialized grammar, which lo longer enumerates the complete folding space, but only those parts defined by your drawing. gra_locomotif_microstate.gap serves as a prototype grammar for those mechanism and also includes pseudoknots of classes pknotsRG and pKiss.
