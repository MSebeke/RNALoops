The program <a href="http://bibiserv.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/locomotif/">Locomotif</a> is a graphical editor, letting you literally draw your favorite RNA motif, and converts this drawing into a highly specialized grammar, which lo longer enumerates the complete folding space, but only those parts defined by your drawing. &quot;gra_locomotif_microstate.gap&quot; serves as a prototype grammar for those mechanism and also includes pseudoknots of classes <a href="http://bibiserv.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/pknotsrg/">pknotsRG</a> and <a href="http://bibiserv.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/pkiss/">pKiss</a>. It uses the microstate way to cope with dangling bases. The pseudoknot components are outsourced into the grammar fragments <a href="?id=grapart_pkinnars.gap">grapart_pkinnars.gap</a> for the free folding parts of pknotsRG knots, <a href="?id=grapart_pknotsrg.gap">grapart_pknotsrg.gap</a> for the index hacking for pknotsRG knots (pseudoknots cannot be modeled by tree grammars in principal, thus we take a subword an manually subdivide it into necessary parts), and <a href="?id=grapart_pkissA.gap">grapart_pkissA.gap</a> for free folding parts and strategy A for knots of type pKiss.
