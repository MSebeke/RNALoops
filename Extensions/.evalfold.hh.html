&quot;evalfold.hh&quot; is for <a href="http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ronny/RNA/RNAeval.html">RNAeval</a>-like behaviors for Bellman's GAP programs: first input is the RNA sequence, second input must be a structure in Vienna-Dot-Bracket format. The idea is to &quot;abuse&quot; the base-pair filter such that it only allows for the right positions to pair. In addition, the terminal parsers BASE or REGION must enforce to be unpaired, otherwise we get a set of structure with all or just some of the given basepairs.
Furthermore, the generated out_main.cc must be modified to pass the second input to the global Pairs object and remove it before the real algorithm starts. Do this via the <a href="addRNAoptions.pl">Misc/addRNAoptions.pl</a> script!
