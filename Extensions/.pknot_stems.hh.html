One of these canonicalizations is the assumption, that a stem of a pseudoknot must be of maximal length and cannot have interruptions like bulges or internal-loops. The (energetically) best stems for subwords i,j are precomputed in O(n<sup>2</sup> with the function <span class="code">stacklen</span>.
