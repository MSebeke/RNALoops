&quot;alifold.hh&quot; is the complement to the <a href="?id=singlefold.hh">single fold</a> version. 
It basically provides the function <code>basepair</code> to decide if two columns of the alignment are considered to form a base-pair. To judge about beeing paired, the covariance (<code>covscore</code>) defined in <a href="?id=alignment.hh">alignment.hh</a> of these two columns is computed.
