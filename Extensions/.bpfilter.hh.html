&quot;bpfilter.hh&quot; has been used by Jan Reinkensmeier to specifiy a very specific kind of thermodynamic matcher.
The matcher should only consider sub-structures which are composed of at least X base-pairs. We can implement this requirement as a semantic filter, which assesses a candidate <em>after</em> evaluation, here evaluation via algebra <a href="?id=alg_basepairMax.gap">Algebras/alg_basepairMax.gap</a>.<br/>
Since the semantic filter has to operate on the result type, and here it is defined as the product of three algebras, you might have to adapt the compontent (*.first.second) if you want to use this filter in your own code.
