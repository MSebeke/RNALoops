for RNA structure predictions without pseudoknots. This signature comprises functions for all four types of grammars (<a href="../Grammars/gra_nodangle.gap">nodangle</a>, <a href="../Grammars/gra_overdangle.gap">overdangle</a>, <a href="../Grammars/gra_microstate.gap">microstate</a> and <a href="../Grammars/gra_macrostate.gap">macrostate</a>). Thus, it is possible to interchange most of the algebras, only those regarding different dangling effects must be specialized versions. A mild disadvantage is a number of warnings &quot;unused signature symbols&quot; if we compile programs with grammars that do not use all of those functions, which is the case for nodangle, overdangle and microstate. The signature is general enough to handle single sequence or alignment inputs for structure prediction tasks.
