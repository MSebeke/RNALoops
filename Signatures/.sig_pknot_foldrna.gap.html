We provide a separate signature for RNA predictions including pseudoknots (for the two classes of <a href="http://bibiserv.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/pknotsrg/">pknotsRG</a> and <a href="http://bibiserv.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/pkiss/">pKiss</a>). Furthermore, to handle dangling bases, we need a mechanism to address the inward partners of the terminal pseudoknot stems. In our case, this mechanism is an answer tuple for some of the signature functions. Thus, besides the normal &quot;sort&quot; <code>comp</code>, we need a second &quot;sort&quot;, called <code>compKnot</code>.

A significant sub-set of the algebra functions used here is shared with signatures <a href="?id=sig_foldrna.gap">sig_foldrna.gap</a> and <a href="?id=sig_pknot_foldrna.gap">sig_pknot_foldrna.gap</a>. For re-usage, we moved those functions into a separate file (<a href="?id=sigpart_basic.gap">sigpart_basic.gap</a>) and include the same file into the different signatures.
