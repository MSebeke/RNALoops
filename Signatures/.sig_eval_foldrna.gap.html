The problem of evaluating the free energy of a given primary RNA sequence and secondary structure becomes a two track application. The first track reads the sequence, the second track the structure. To inform <a href="bibiserv.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/gapc">GAP-C</a> (Bellman's GAP compiler) about the ordering of the tracks we need this specialized signature, although the grammar structure remains the same. A further specialty for this problem is that we always read the same number of terminal symbols in both tracks, thus we would not need separate moving bounderies for both tracks. Unfortunately, GAP-C doesn't recognize this and we have to manually adapt the generated code to gain efficient programs.
