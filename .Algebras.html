Spanning a search space with a grammar is useless unless we evaluate (and select) the candidates with an algebra. The following algebras are available and solve many of the known and elsewhere implemented RNA related problems. Due to the power and re-usability of algebra products simple combination of existing algebras might easily solve new emerging problems. We describe in the following the toolbox of our algebras:
